# A Chat Room

###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This is a very simple agorithm consisting mainly from two main counters in one iteration.
- The input word counter
- The "hello" counter

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Input word Counter
    it is made to go through every character in a string and compare it with the 
    current selected character in the "hello" counter till it find each character in the right order.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "hello" Counter
    it is made mainly as an indicator for comparison as the _i_ variable represents
    the current character index and it increases every time we have a match;
    Till it forms the "hello" word if not the size of i and hello will not be
    the same.
